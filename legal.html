<p> The Gambling Commission, a publically funded organisation founded in 2007 in the UK, govern
gaming, including online gaming. Its main focus is to regulate and maintain gambling in all forms.
With the development of technology and the internet being so accessible, it has recently focused on
social gaming due to the element of chance in these games, especially ones that mimic gambling
games. It is also concerned about the number of games that use virtual currency that can be bought
using PayPal or a credit card.

The Gambling Act 2005 defines gaming as &#39;&#39;playing a game of chance for a prize&#39;&#39;. Social gaming sites
can offer real money prizes, provided that their games are purely skill-based.
Matters become complicated when an online social game of chance offers virtual money as
rewards/prizes, the Commission says it complicates issues. </p>
