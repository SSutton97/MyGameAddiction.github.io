<h2> UK Law </h2>

<div id="uk-info">
  <p>The Gambling Commission, a publically funded organisation founded in 2007 in the UK, govern gaming, including online gaming. Its main focus is to regulate and maintain gambling in all forms. With the development of technology and the internet being so accessible, it has recently focused on social gaming due to the element of chance in these games, especially ones that mimic gambling games. It is also concerned about the number of games that use virtual currency that can be bought using PayPal or a credit card. 
The Gambling Act 2005 defines gaming as ''playing a game of chance for a prize''. Social gaming sites can offer real money prizes, provided that their games are purely skill-based. 
Matters become complicated when an online social game of chance offers virtual money as rewards/prizes, the Commission says it complicates issues. 
</p>


<p>The central piece of legislation in the UK that includes online gaming/video gaming, still remains the Gambling Act 2005. It: </p>
<ul>
		<li> Has x3 objectives: to prevent gambling from being (1) a source of crime/disorder (2) it is not associated with crime/disorder (3) it is used to support crime</li>
		<li>It aims to protect children/young persons </li>
		<li> To ensure any/all gambling is conducted in a fair and open way</li>
		<li> applies to all kinds of technological appliances</li>
		<li> Is managed by the Gambling Commission</li>
		<li> Deals with crime and offences</li>
		<li> Offers information on all kinds of licenses</li>
		<li> Gambling is defined as being (1) Gaming (2) Betting (3) Lottery</li>
</ul>

<p> ‘Gaming’ is defined as playing a game of chance to receive a reward. This applies to games that need both skill and luck/chance. Some games are just skill based such as draughts or chess where as any games that involve a dice, random luck or chance determining the game, is included in the GA 2005. </p>
